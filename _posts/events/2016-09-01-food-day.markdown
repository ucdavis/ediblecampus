Every October 24, thousands of events all around the country bring Americans together to celebrate and enjoy real food and to push for improved food policies.

October 24 is a day to resolve to make changes in our own diets and to take action to solve food-related problems in our communities at the local, state, and national level.

This annual event involves some of the countryâ€™s most prominent food activists, united by a vision of food that is healthy, affordable, and produced with care for the environment, farm animals, and the people who grow, harvest, and serve it.
