        <title>Pitch-and-Plant your ideas in campus gardening contest</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At the Horticulture Innovation Lab Demonstration Center on campus, a few empty raised garden beds are waiting for some new plants. The “Pitch-and-Plant” gardening contest invites students and community members to help fill those garden beds with interesting plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This outdoor site is currently home to vegetables varieties from Africa and Asia, such as spider plant and leafy amaranth. The center also displays agricultural tools that university researchers use with small-scale farmers in developing countries. Visitors are welcome; find the &lt;a href=&quot;http://campusmap.ucdavis.edu/?l=860&quot;&gt;Horticulture Innovation Lab Demonstration Center on the campus map.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To participate, July 1 is the deadline to make your pitch for what you would like to plant in just three PowerPoint slides. Send this quick pitch to Britta Hansen, &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#098;&amp;#104;&amp;#097;&amp;#110;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#064;&amp;#117;&amp;#099;&amp;#100;&amp;#097;&amp;#118;&amp;#105;&amp;#115;&amp;#046;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;&quot;&gt;&amp;#098;&amp;#104;&amp;#097;&amp;#110;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#064;&amp;#117;&amp;#099;&amp;#100;&amp;#097;&amp;#118;&amp;#105;&amp;#115;&amp;#046;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;&lt;/a&gt;. Those with winning ideas could be getting their hands dirty with planting as early as July 18. Winners will be responsible for maintaining their creative garden plants (and eating their own harvest too!) for the rest of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See full details about how to participate in the Pitch-and-Plant contest flier.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kansas City Food Scraps</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My grandmother was composting before ‘sustainability’ held international weight. Her fascination with her Kansas City food scraps was - despite her archetypal grandma kookiness- nothing short of visionary. Her sloping, Bermuda Grass backyard was renovated with 3 raised beds in 2004, back when I, a 9 year-old tallboy, was infatuated with dirt. Back before I knew to distinguish dirt from soil, and gave onions not a second’s thought. My grandmother’s garden was the first one I met; it was a corn-belt soliloquy, iridescent in the springtime sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food is clearly congregative. It’s a cosmic simplicity, satiating our gurgly bellies. Though, our palettes have adjusted to expect french fries over potatoes. These simple artificial transformations have split us farther from our food, consequently, farther from our soils. The complexities of today’s food system have trained us to leapfrog parts of commodity chains, making less out of more. We now anticipate the conclusive, processed versions of the same foods originating in our backyard gardens; raw has turned refined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enact change is no dainty feat, and a small garden is hardly enough for a head-nod of approval in our global food system. Regardless, real change is most positive when comprised of of passion-fueled, small but mighty little guys. The Salad Bowl Garden is one of those little guys, growing veggies for public consumption. Plants produced by the people for the people. 100% of what’s grown is for the taking, and the cleverly situated garden site stands valiantly as both a placeholder and a production zone. Nestled smack-dab in the PES (Plant and Environmental Sciences) courtyard, the Salad Bowl Garden is equal parts aesthetics and exposure. After all, what is an ag. school experience if swiss chard and peppers aren’t beckoning for your harvest as you leave class? The power in a garden is its direct path to the kitchen table from the soil. There is no processing or unnecessary additives. That swiss chard and those peppers are turned to salad, stuffed pies, chili pastes and stir fries. Not only does it encourage healthy eating, it exposes students to the kitchen, to turning what they can find outside into what they can fill their bodies with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, more than anything else, is my grandmother’s mission statement. To turn soil to sustenance, with cooking snuggled in between. To engage young and old in the collaboration that is edible spaces, and to produce, engage and enthuse the public in a movement towards playing a more congregative, cognizant and devoted role in our food system.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>College Celebration</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;Tom&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &#39;Hi, Tom&#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll docs&lt;/a&gt; for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;. If you have questions, you can ask them on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Salad Bowl Garden</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started in 2008, the Salad Bowl Garden is run by students and eaten by anyone. Situated just outside the Plant and Environmental Sciences building, the Salad Bowl Garden is an interactive edible landscape where you can pick your salad and eat fresh food while at school or work. A range of crops are grown to meet staff and student preferences, be eaten raw, and follow healthy agronomic practices. Check out the garden signs to learn about vegetable varieties, water-saving irrigation techniques, organic fertilization methods, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Get Involved&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The garden team regularly hosts salad bowl lunches, where all are invited to harvest and enjoy their own salads. Additionally, all members of the UC Davis community are welcome to visit the garden at any time and harvest as they please!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Horticulture Innovation Lab Demonstration Center</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Horticulture Innovation Lab Demonstration Center displays some of the vegetables and innovative technologies that the Horticulture Innovation Lab uses with farmers around the world. This is an active site for students, faculty, and staff to test new horticultural tools and demonstrate best practices for growing fruits and vegetables — particularly those helpful to small-scale farmers in developing countries. Some of the agricultural technologies on display include a low-cost drip irrigation kit, a floating garden, postharvest cooling chambers, and solar dryers. The demonstration center is spearheaded by the Horticulture Innovation Lab and is also part of the UC Davis GATEways Project, a campuswide initiative developed by the UC Davis Arboretum and Public Garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Get Involved&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the demonstration center, visit the Horticulture Innovation Lab &lt;a href=&quot;http://horticulture.ucdavis.edu/main/center_ucdavis.html&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.horticulture.ucdavis.edu/2015/06/our-newest-center-here-at-uc-davis/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biological Orchard and Gardens (BOG) is a collaboration between students, staff, and faculty to convert an underutilized landscape in the heart of campus into a living museum which showcase permaculture practices and biodiversity. A quarter of the space will feature a first-of-its-kind orchard of heirloom California fruit trees threatened with extinction. Once it is established, visitors to the garden are free to sample the harvests. The remaining space will serve as an outdoor ecological classroom, featuring drought-tolerant plants native to South Africa, the Mediterranean, Australia, Chile, and California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Get Involved&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow the BOG on Facebook: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/ucdBOG&quot;&gt;www.facebook.com/ucdBOG&lt;/a&gt;. To join the BOG team as an intern, volunteer, or supporter, leave a message on Facebook, or contact Student Project Manager Emily Dorrance at &lt;a href=&quot;eadorrance@ucdavis.edu&quot;&gt;eadorrance@ucdavis.edu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
