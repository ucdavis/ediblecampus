<h2>About</h2>

The Biological Orchard and Gardens (BOG) is a collaboration between students, staff, and faculty to convert an underutilized landscape in the heart of campus into a living museum which showcase permaculture practices and biodiversity. A quarter of the space will feature a first-of-its-kind orchard of heirloom California fruit trees threatened with extinction. Once it is established, visitors to the garden are free to sample the harvests. The remaining space will serve as an outdoor ecological classroom, featuring drought-tolerant plants native to South Africa, the Mediterranean, Australia, Chile, and California.
