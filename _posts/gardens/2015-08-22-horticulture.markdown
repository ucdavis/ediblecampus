<h2>About</h2>

The Horticulture Innovation Lab Demonstration Center displays some of the vegetables and innovative technologies that the Horticulture Innovation Lab uses with farmers around the world. This is an active site for students, faculty, and staff to test new horticultural tools and demonstrate best practices for growing fruits and vegetables â€” particularly those helpful to small-scale farmers in developing countries. Some of the agricultural technologies on display include a low-cost drip irrigation kit, a floating garden, postharvest cooling chambers, and solar dryers. The demonstration center is spearheaded by the Horticulture Innovation Lab and is also part of the UC Davis GATEways Project, a campuswide initiative developed by the UC Davis Arboretum and Public Garden.
