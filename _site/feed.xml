&lt;p&gt;This annual event involves some of the country’s most prominent food activists, united by a vision of food that is healthy, affordable, and produced with care for the environment, farm animals, and the people who grow, harvest, and serve it. Read about how to get involved &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foodday.org/get_involved&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
