<h2>About</h2>

On the south side of the Student Health and Wellness Center is the welcoming Student Wellness Garden. Within this Garden is the the small, organically grown Harvest Garden that offers visitors an opportunity to learn about the benefits of growing and eating fresh fruit and vegetables. Cared for by Health Education and Promotion student staff and volunteers, it serves as an area for students to enjoy and engage in garden care.

The Healing Patch is a medicinal garden also incorporated into the Student Wellness Garden. Many of the plants in this space are medicinal and used for ethnobotanical purposes.
