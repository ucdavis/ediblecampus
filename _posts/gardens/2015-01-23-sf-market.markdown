<h2>About</h2>

The Student Farm is a community where students work to create, maintain, and explore sustainable food systems. The Market Garden is a seven acre section of the Student Farm where students grow fruits and vegetables year round for the UC Davis community to eat. The farm provides students with year round opportunities to learn and participate in agricultural activitiesâ€”through field activities, classes, and independent student projects. Students take the lead in all phases of organic vegetable production and marketing including growing transplants in the greenhouse, direct seeding and transplanting of crops, field preparation, irrigation, cultivation, pest management, harvesting, packing and marketing.


<h2>Get Involved</h2>

Students can participate as volunteers and interns, as part of the Organic Crop Production Practices class (PLS 49) offered every year, or as a Lead Student Farmer. Throughout the year, the Market Garden is open on weekdays from 8am to 12pm.
