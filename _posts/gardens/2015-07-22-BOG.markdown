###About
The Biological Orchard and Gardens (BOG) is a collaboration between students, staff, and faculty to convert an underutilized landscape in the heart of campus into a living museum which showcase permaculture practices and biodiversity. A quarter of the space will feature a first-of-its-kind orchard of heirloom California fruit trees threatened with extinction. Once it is established, visitors to the garden are free to sample the harvests. The remaining space will feature drought-tolerant plants native to South Africa, the Mediterranean, and California, serving as an outdoor ecological classroom.
