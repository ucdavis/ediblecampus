<h2>About</h2>

The mission of the Good Life Garden is to expose and educate a wide audience to the relationship between good food and good health. The Good Life Gardenâ€™s ever-changing edible landscape features organic and sustainably grown vegetables, herbs, and flowers accompanied by compelling food and health educational signage. A portion of the Good Life Garden is cultivated by Edible Landscaping interns into an aesthetically-pleasing, biointensive edible garden that builds community and increases student food access. The Edible Landscaping interns envision their garden as part of UC Davis' Sustainable 2nd Century vision, employing a design philosophy that coalesces environmental, social, and economic benefits for visitors and participants.
