###About
Started in 2008, the Salad Bowl Garden is run by students and eaten by anyone. Situated just outside the Plant and Environmental Sciences building, the Salad Bowl Garden is an interactive edible landscape where you can pick your salad and eat fresh food while at school or work. A range of crops are grown to meet staff and student preferences, be eaten raw, and follow healthy agronomic practices. Check out the garden signs to learn about vegetable varieties, water-saving irrigation techniques, organic fertilization methods, and more.

###Get Involved
Each quarter, the garden team hosts salad bowl lunches, where all are invited to harvest and enjoy their own salads. Additionally, all members of the UC Davis community are welcome to visit the garden at any time and harvest as they please! Stop by the Salad Bowl Garden on Picnic Day - April 16, 2016 - for fun activities put on by students in the [Arboretum and Public Gardenâ€™s Edible Landscaping Internship.](http://arboretum.ucdavis.edu/student_opportunities.aspx)
