<h2>About</h2>

The Tri-Cooperatives (or Tri-Coops) are an on-campus student housing association that seek to foster educational and personal growth and provide safe and affordable living. The three houses--Davis Student Co-op, Pierce, and Agrarian Effort--share a large garden space that is frequently cultivated by residents and other students for healthy food and enjoyment.

<h2>Get Involved</h2>

All are welcome to attend the Tri-Coopsâ€™ garden workdays every Friday afternoon. To learn more about the Tri-Coops, visit their [Davis Wiki page.](https://localwiki.org/davis/Tri-Cooperatives)
