<h2>About</h2>

In this unique area of the Student Farm, students manage a 1/3 acre vineyard of table grapes. The vineyard, which boasts four different varieties of red and white table grapes, provides a place for students to learn about and develop skills in a number of different cultural practices and techniques used in producing organic grapes.


<h2>Get Involved</h2>

Students, preferably with prior experience at the Student Farm, can participate in the vineyard internship during the winter and spring quarters. For more information about vineyard internship opportunities, visit the [website.](http://asi.ucdavis.edu/programs/sf/programs/student-farm-vineyard)
